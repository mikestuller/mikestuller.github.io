*Q: What is a Euclidean Rhythm?*

A: A Euclidean rhythm is a type of rhythm found in many musical styles.  To make a Euclidean rhythm, break up a time interval into equal-length steps. Then place a beat at the beginning of some of the steps.  If the beats are as evenly-spaced as possible, the pattern is a Euclidean Rhythm.

For example, you can make a rhythm with 2 beats on 4 steps.  It will be Euclidean if the beats are on step 1 and 3 (or on step 2 and step 4).

Here's a more interesting example: 5 beats on 16 steps.  The only way to distribute the beats as evenly as possible is to put them on steps 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13 (or the same rhythm shifted in time).  When shifted by 6 steps, it is the Bossa Nova rhythm.

**Q: Can I use Euclidium to play Garage Band Instruments?**

A: On macOS, you first need to enable the virtual midi port using Audio MIDI Setup.  See https://support.apple.com/guide/audio-midi-setup/transfer-midi-information-between-apps-ams1013/mac

On iOS, unfortunately Garage Band doesn't easily support virtual MIDI instruments, so we haven't found a way to integrate Garage Band and Euclidium.  (If you know how to do so, please let us know!)
