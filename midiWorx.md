## midiWorx

## Overview

midiWorx is an app that lets you create, modify, and direct MIDI messages -- among other things. It consists of many "modules" -- things like MIDI filters, MIDI note generators, and more. While most of the modules can be useful on their own or in small combinations, the most powerful aspect of midiWorx is its ability to flexibly combine modules by connecting them with each other however you want to.

Here's an example: You could use a Midi In module to receive notes generated from an external keyboard. Then you could use a Note Splitter module to split the notes into a lower portion and an upper portion. You could then apply an Arpeggiator to only the upper portion, and a Transposer to transpose the the lower portion down an octave. Finally, you could use Midi Out modules to send the lower portion to a sound-generating app and the upper portion to an external synthesizer.

### What is MIDI?

MIDI stands for "Musical Instrument Digital Interface". It is the standard protocol by which electronic music devices (like synthesizers) communicate with each other. It's important to realized that MIDI does not transmit recorded sounds. Rather, you can think of MIDI messages as being directions such as "play Middle C with velocity 93" (In the MIDI standard, "velocity" refers to how hard or loud a note is played.)

Typically, a device like a keyboard or some other "MIDI controller" would be used to generate and transmit MIDI messages to another device, such as a sound module. It is up to the sound module to generate and play the notes (the actual sounds) with the pitches and velocities specified by the messages.
